The requirements.txt file might not have worked as expected due 
to incomplete package listings, dependency conflicts, platform-specific issues, 
or differences between Conda and Pip environments. Manually verify the requirements.txt content, 
address any version conflicts, and consider using conda env export to generate an accurate 
environment.yml file. Testing the requirements.txt file in a new virtual environment can help 
identify and resolve these issues, ensuring all necessary dependencies are correctly installed.
